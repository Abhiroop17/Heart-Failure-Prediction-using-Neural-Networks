# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks

**Overview**
Heart failure is a critical medical condition that occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodyâ€™s needs. Early prediction of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention. This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical data, such as patient demographics, laboratory results, and lifestyle factors.

**Objective**
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify patients as being at risk of heart failure or not. This can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care.

**Dataset Descriptio**n
The dataset used for this project contains clinical records of patients, with the following key features:

Age: Age of the patient in years.

Anaemia: Whether the patient has a low red blood cell count (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK): Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L).

Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Ejection Fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (%).

High Blood Pressure: Presence of hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Platelets: Platelet count in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL).

Serum Creatinine: Level of creatinine in the blood (mg/dL).

Serum Sodium: Level of sodium in the blood (mEq/L).

Sex: Gender of the patient (Male = 1, Female = 0).

Smoking: Whether the patient is a smoker (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Time: Follow-up period (days).

Death Event: Target variable indicating if the patient died during follow-up (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

**Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing**:

Handle missing values and outliers.

Normalize or standardize numerical features.

Encode categorical variables if necessary.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

Analyze the distribution of features.

Identify correlations between features and the target variable.

Visualize patterns using heatmaps, histograms, and box plots.

**Model Development**:

Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify the best performer.
Fine-tune hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.

**Model Evaluation**:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

Analyze the confusion matrix to understand false positives and false negatives.

**Key Challenges**

Balancing the dataset if there is a class imbalance (e.g., significantly more non-fatal cases than fatal ones).

Avoiding overfitting, especially when dealing with small datasets.

Interpreting clinical data to ensure predictions align with medical knowledge.

**Outcome**
The final model predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart failure, with high accuracy and reliability. It can be used by healthcare providers as a decision-support tool to prioritize patients for further tests or interventions.

**Tools and Technologies**

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow 

Environment: Google Colab

**Potential Applications**

Clinical Decision Support: Aid in identifying high-risk patients for further diagnostic testing.

Remote Health Monitoring: Integrate with wearable devices to predict heart failure risk in real-time.
